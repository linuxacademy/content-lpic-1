The Cows and the Grasshopper

THE COWS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected
in the summertime.  A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed
by and earnestly begged for a little food.  The Cows inquired of
him, 'Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?'  He
replied, 'I had not leisure enough.  I passed the days in
singing.'  They then said in derision:  'If you were foolish enough
to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the
winter.'
